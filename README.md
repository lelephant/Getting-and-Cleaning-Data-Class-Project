# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Class-Project
My script for the class project, for the class, Getting and Cleaning Data, along w/ readme and code book.

Assuming the Samsung data set(provided for project) is in your working directory under the name UCI HAR Dataset, this script will pull the necessary files, combine the testing and training data, extract the columns associated with the mean and standard deviation, and create a new tidy data set. It will then create a 2nd data set averaging the value of the observations grouped by Subject ID and activity. SEE COMMENTS AND CODE FOR MORE DETAIL.
